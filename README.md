# Hello there!

This is my first ever website made entirely in Visual Studio Code. If theres any advice or improvements you can give me, please do! I'd love to improve and turn this into a valuable skill. 

Law school (though I enjoy it) is not something that I'd rather do over software related things. I'd rather not take the traditional path to becoming software engineer. However, a bachelors (or even a masters) degree in computer engineering/science has been viewed as useless in order to get a position. This website as well as any other projects is my attempt at a different approach.  

I've been told by actual engineers that getting your work out there is something far more effective than sitting in your dorm room chugging red bull on an empty stomach. Although it adds to the things I have to do, it's far more preferable over the latter. For my contact information, please head to the "for the inquiries" section, or email me at Silly@rudonic.ca.
